ABOUT THE COURSE:

The course covers basic algorithmic techniques and ideas for computational problems arising frequently in practical applications: sorting and searching, divide and conquer, greedy algorithms, dynamic programming.I learnt a lot of theory: how to sort data and how it helps for searching; how to break a large problem into pieces and solve them recursively; when it makes sense to proceed greedily; how dynamic programming is used in genomic studies.I practiced solving computational problems, designing new algorithms, and implementing solutions efficiently (so that they run in less than a second)
