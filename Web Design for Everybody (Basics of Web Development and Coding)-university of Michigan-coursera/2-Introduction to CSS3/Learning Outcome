ABOUT THE COURSE"

The web today is almost unrecognizable from the early days of white pages with lists of blue links.  Now, sites are designed with complex layouts, unique fonts, and customized color schemes.   This course introduced me to the basics of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS3).  The emphasis was be on learning how to write CSS rules, how to test code, and how to establish good programming habits.     

When done correctly, the styling of a webpage can take enhance page.   When done incorrectly the result can be worse than no styling at all.    To ensure that sites do not put up  barriers for people with cognitive and/or physical disabilities, I was made to  learn how to evaluate pages using the standardized POUR accessibility guidelines.    Upon completion of the course, I was able to sketch a design for a given HTML page.  Using that design I used CSS to implement the design by adding fonts, colors, and  layouts.    

This is the second course in the Web Design For Everybody specialization.   Subsequent courses focus on adding interaction with JavaScript and enhancing the styling with responsive design.
