ABOUT THE COURSE:

In The capstone I developed a professional-quality web portfolio. Demonstrated the ability to design and implement a responsive site for a minimum of three platforms.  Adherence to validation and accessibility standards was required. The evolving student implementations was reviewed each week by capstone peers and teaching assistants to make sure that the student keeps up with the agenda of the course. 

Upon completion of this course it was easy creating and/or updating existing front-end sites, utilizing existing frameworks, and testing sites for accessibility compliance.

This course is only open to students who have completed the first four courses in the Web Design for Everybody specialization: Introduction to HTML5, Introduction to CSS3, Interactivity with JavaScript, and Advanced Styling with Responsive Design
