ABOUT THE COURSE:
In this course, Hands-on instruction of advanced Excel 2013 functions was given.  I learnt how to use PowerPivot to build databases and data models. I was also shown how to perform different types of scenario and simulation analysis and was given an opportunity to practice these skills by leveraging some of Excel's built in tools including, solver, data tables, scenario manager and goal seek.  In the second half of the course,  learnt how to visualize data, tell a story and explore data by reviewing core principles of data visualization and dashboarding.  I used Excel to build complex graphs and Power View reports and then start to combine them into dynamic dashboards.
