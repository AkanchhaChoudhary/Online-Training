ABOUT THE COURSE:

What are some of the most popular data science tools, how do we use them, and what are their features? In this course, I learnt about Jupyter Notebooks, RStudio IDE, Apache Zeppelin and Data Science Experience.I also learnt about what each tool is used for, what programming languages they can execute, their features and limitations. With the tools hosted in the cloud on Cognitive Class Labs, I was enabled  to test each tool and follow instructions to run simple code in Python, R or Scala. To end the course, I created a final project with a Jupyter Notebook on IBM Data Science Experience and demonstrate my proficiency preparing a notebook, writing Markdown, and sharing my work with my peers.
