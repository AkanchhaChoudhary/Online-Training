try:
    s = raw_input("please input your score:")
    score = float(s)
    if score > 1.0:
        print "value out of range"
    elif 1.0 >= score>=.9:
        print "A"
    elif .9 > score>=.8:
        print "B"
    elif .8 >score>=.7:
        print "D"    
    elif .7 >score>=.6:
        print "D"
