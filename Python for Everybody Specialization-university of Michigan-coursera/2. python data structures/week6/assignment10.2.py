10.2 Write a program to read through the mbox-short.txt and figure out
the distribution by hour of the day for each of the messages.
You can pull the hour out from the 'From ' line by finding the time and then
splitting the string a second time using a colon.

Once you have accumulated the counts for each hour, print out the counts,
sorted by hour as shown below.
