WHAT I DID THROUGHOUT THIS COURSE:


Through presentations, demonstrations, and readings, I was introduced to security concepts for use with Amazon Web Services (AWS). 

Each week has focus on different aspects of security on AWS.  In week one there was reviews for some basic concepts such as "least privilege" and the "shared security model". I learnT about AWS compliance programs, and look at securing AWS accounts using AWS IAM. 

In the second week,  focus was on securing the infrastructure.  I was introduced to basic network isolation and endpoint security. I went through detective controls such as Amazon Cloudtrail and AWS Cloudtrail as well as the AWS Security Hub, Amazon GuardDuty and AWS Config.

Week three has focus on data protection.  looked at encryption of data at rest, in motion, and best practices for how to store data within and between various AWS services.

In the final week of the course, I was introduced  at protecting compute resources such as Amazon EC2 and AWS Lambda as well as managing secrets and finish off the course with a look at the AWS Well-Architected Framework

Class forums also allowed me to ask questions and interact with AWS training instructors.
