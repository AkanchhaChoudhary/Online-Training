ABOUT THIS COURSE:

Through this course I learnt how to get started with AWS Machine Learning. 
Key topics include: 
1.Machine Learning on AWS, 
2.Computer Vision on AWS, 
3.and Natural Language Processing (NLP) on AWS. 
Each topic consists of several modules deep-diving into variety of ML concepts, AWS services as well as insights from experts to put the concepts into practice.
