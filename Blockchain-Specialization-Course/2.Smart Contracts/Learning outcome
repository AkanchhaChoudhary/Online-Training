ABOUT THIS COURSE:


This second course of the Blockchain specialization was helpful to design, code, deploy and execute a smart contract â€“ the computational element of the blockchain technology. Smart contracts allow for implementing user-defined operations of arbitrary complexity that are not possible through plain cryptocurrency protocols. They allow users to implement conditions, rules and policies of the domain applications. Smart contracts are a powerful feature that, when properly designed and coded, can result in autonomous, efficient and transparent systems. 

I designed and programed smart contracts in Solidity language, test and deploy them in the Remix development environment, and invoked them from a simple web interface that Remix provides. This course features best practices for designing solutions with smart contracts using Solidity and Remix IDE.
